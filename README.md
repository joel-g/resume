# Joel Guerra
## IT professional turned Developer:
I have experience in web development, sales, marketing, graphic design and enterprise IT.
This experience makes me well-rounded programmer who can seamlessly collaborate with managers, colleagues and
clients. When I'm not writing code I'm planning my next project. When I'm not doing either of those I'm building cars and
going on adventures with my wife and children. Call me to discuss how I can contribute to your team.
